## Description
-Two SG90 Servos

-One MG90 Servo

-Three popsicle sticks

I used an MG90 servo as the **hip servo**, and the 2 SD90 servos for the **knee** and **ankle** joints. The popsicles of the femur and tibia were both **7cm**, while the foot was of **unrecorded** length

## Up next
Now, I want to attach this to the arduino and write a simple program to change the angles of the servos by pushing **buttons**. It will help me to see what positions I want the leg to move to, and confirm whether the leg can move as expected.
