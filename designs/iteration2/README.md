## Description
-The flat rectangle on top of the robot is meant to represent the **Arduino UNO**

-The feet was designed based on toy robots to **improve stability and reduce weight**

-The cuboids with cylinders popping out represent the **servos**

## What's next
I'm satisfied with how the design looks. I think this is the end of my first design process, and I'll now proceed to building a **prototype leg.**
