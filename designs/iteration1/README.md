# Iteration1-First Ideas
## What I wanted
I wanted to make a something simple that I knew could walk and stand upright. Searching through the internet gave me some ideas for early sketches, like the Leggy and the Ducky.

## Design Idea
Eventually, I was inspired by the way ostriches moves, and hence, I designed the Ostrich based on its leg movements. The leg is designed to bend inwards, which might present a challenge for generating the walking sequence. Nevertheless, I have chosen this design:

## What Next?
I'll try making a CAD of this sketch so I can practice my CAD skills and see a 3d model of the robot itself
