# Walker
## Project Overview
I'm creating a 2-legged walking robot to learn how inverse kinematics works, robot design, and because it seemed like an awesome idea.
## Goals
-Build a stable robot that stands

-Explore inverse kinematics and trigonometry

-Create walking sequence 

-Iterate on designs until robot is able to walk smoothly

## Repository files
- /designs: Designs for the robot, including sketches and CAD
- /code: Code for the robot
- /media: Photos and videos of tests
- /docs: Notes and calculations

## Development log
