# Walker
## Project Overview 🔍
I'm creating a 2-legged walking robot to learn how inverse kinematics works, robot design, and because it seemed like an awesome idea.
## Goals 🥅
-Build a stable robot

-Explore inverse kinematics and trigonometry

-Create walking sequence 

-Iterate on designs until robot is able to walk smoothly

## Repository files 📁
- /designs: Designs for the robot, including sketches and CAD
- /code: Code for the robot
- /media: Photos and videos of tests
- /docs: Notes and calculations

## Development log 🗒️
-Design--Iteration1

<i>Iteration 1 on the robot design</i>

**Synopsis**: I settled on the robot design sketch "Ostrich" inspired by ostrich leg movement
